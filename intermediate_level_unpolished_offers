please make me a list of all the intermediate level services a solo cyber security professional can offer a small business?

Below is a clear, comprehensive list of intermediate-level cybersecurity services a solo cybersecurity professional can offer to small businesses. These go beyond basics but remain realistic for a one-person practice—no enterprise SOC or red-team operations required.

Shadow IT discovery and risk review


2. Vulnerability Management (Non-Exploitative)

Scheduled vulnerability scanning program

Prioritization & remediation guidance

Patch program design & automation recommendations

Third-party software risk assessment

3. Security Architecture & Hardening

Network segmentation planning

Firewall and UTM configuration improvements

Zero Trust–inspired access controls (least privilege, conditional access)

4. Cloud Security Engineering

Advanced Microsoft 365 security hardening

Conditional Access

Defender for Office 365 configurations
