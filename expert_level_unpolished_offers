please make me a list of all the expert level services a solo cyber security professional can offer a small business?

Below is a comprehensive list of expert-level cybersecurity services that a solo cybersecurity professional can realistically and safely offer to small businesses, without crossing into services that require a full SOC, a red-team, or enterprise-grade infrastructure.
These represent the highest-value, highest-skill, and highest-margin offerings available to an independent consultant.
